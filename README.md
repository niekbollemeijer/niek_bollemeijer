# Dr. Niek Bollemeijer

My name is Niek Bollemeijer and I have recently defended my PhD thesis, titled `New spectral-timing techniques across the full X-ray band: revealing the dynamic corona in black hole X-ray binaries', at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by Dr. Phil Uttley. My research is focused on the variability in the X-ray flux that is observed from accreting black holes, which will be explained in more detail on this website. 

This website is still work in progress.
